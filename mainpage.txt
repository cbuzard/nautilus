@section Introduction

A fast 1D gas-grain chemical model by FH (2008)\n
Based upon the OSU gas-grain chemical model\n
Updated from gg_osu_2006v1d by RTG/VW\n
Rate equations from Hasegawa & Herbst (1992)\n
Modified rates following Caselli et al. (1998)\n
Stiff solver for sparse Jacobians: LSODES/ODEPACK (Hindmarsh 1983)\n
Turbulent mixing implemented through first order operator splitting\n

@section Errors

Error 1: Missing input file.

Error 2: Species name in reaction do not match expected list of species

Error 3: More elements than NB_PRIME_ELEMENTS

Error 4: When reordering reactions, it seems that some reactions misses or not expected

Error 5: In parameter file, IS_DIFFUSIVITY has a value that is not recognized by the code

Error 6: The number of prime elements in input files *_species.in do not match with the real one coming from element.in
