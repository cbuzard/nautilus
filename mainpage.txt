@section section1 Introduction

A fast 1D gas-grain chemical model by FH (2008)\n
Based upon the OSU gas-grain chemical model\n
Updated from gg_osu_2006v1d by RTG/VW\n
Rate equations from Hasegawa & Herbst (1992)\n
Modified rates following Caselli et al. (1998)\n
Stiff solver for sparse Jacobians: LSODES/ODEPACK (Hindmarsh 1983)\n
Turbulent mixing implemented through first order operator splitting\n

@section section_input Input files

All parameters file can have comments, either a full line or the end of a line. The comment character being the '!' character. 
Blanck lines are ignored

<b>parameters.in</b> : parameter file of the code, with various flags

<b>abundances.in</b> : Give initial abundances for a set of species (a reduced number or all. Default minimum values are applied for those
that do not exist in this file.

<b>activation_energies.in</b> : Activation energy for endothermic reactions

<b>element.in</b> : name and mass in AMU of all elemental species existing in the simulation

<b>gas_reactions.in</b> : Reaction that occurs in gas phase

<b>gas_species.in</b> : species that are involved in gas phase reactions

<b>grain_reactions.in</b> : Reactions that occurs on grain surface

<b>grain_species.in</b> : Species that are involved in grain surface reactions

<b>surface_parameters.in</b> : various energies and parameters for diffusion and movements on the grain surface

@section section_output Output files

*.out files are output files. *.tmp files are file that are generated at each timestep, either to continue a 
simulation or check if there is a problem

<b>abundances.*.out</b> : writing in binary format the abundances of all species at each timestep (one file per timestep-output

<b>abundances.tmp</b> : writing in ASCII format the abundances of all species at the current timestep-output

<b>rates.*.out</b> : writing in binary format the critical reactions rates

<b>info.out</b> : writing information on the code, in particular about the code version (commit ID and branch)

<b>species.out</b> : Writing the list of species and their corresponding index

<b>elemental_abundances.tmp/out</b> : writing information about prime elements, their total abundances and mass

@section section_example How To Use
A folder containing an example simulation is available in example_simulation/

@section section_errors Errors

Error 1: Missing input file.

Error 2: Species name in reaction do not match expected list of species

Error 3: More elements than NB_PRIME_ELEMENTS

Error 4: When reordering reactions, it seems that some reactions misses or not expected

Error 5: In parameter file, IS_DIFFUSIVITY has a value that is not recognized by the code

Error 6: The number of prime elements in input files *_species.in do not match with the real one coming from element.in
