@section Introduction

A fast 1D gas-grain chemical model by FH (2008)\n
Based upon the OSU gas-grain chemical model\n
Updated from gg_osu_2006v1d by RTG/VW\n
Rate equations from Hasegawa & Herbst (1992)\n
Modified rates following Caselli et al. (1998)\n
Stiff solver for sparse Jacobians: LSODES/ODEPACK (Hindmarsh 1983)\n
Turbulent mixing implemented through first order operator splitting\n

@section Input files

All parameters file can have comments, either a full line or the end of a line. The comment character being the '!' character. 
Blanck lines are ignored

parameters.in : parameter file of the code, with various flags

abundances.in : Give initial abundances for a set of species (a reduced number or all. Default minimum values are applied for those
that do not exist in this file.

activation_energies.in : Activation energy for endothermic reactions

element.in : name and mass in AMU of all elemental species existing in the simulation

gas_reactions.in : Reaction that occurs in gas phase

gas_species.in : species that are involved in gas phase reactions

grain_reactions.in : Reactions that occurs on grain surface

grain_species.in : Species that are involved in grain surface reactions

surface_parameters.in : various energies and parameters for diffusion and movements on the grain surface



@section Errors

Error 1: Missing input file.

Error 2: Species name in reaction do not match expected list of species

Error 3: More elements than NB_PRIME_ELEMENTS

Error 4: When reordering reactions, it seems that some reactions misses or not expected

Error 5: In parameter file, IS_DIFFUSIVITY has a value that is not recognized by the code

Error 6: The number of prime elements in input files *_species.in do not match with the real one coming from element.in
